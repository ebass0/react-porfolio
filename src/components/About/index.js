            <p className='About-text'>In high school, my passion for chemistry led me to pursue Biomedicine in 2021. However, my journey took an unexpected turn when my HelpDesk job introduced me to the realm of technology. With a childhood fascination for computers and hardware, I instantly felt a connection. In 2022, I made a pivotal decision to enroll in Analysis and Systems Development. Fast forward to the present, I dedicate each day to studying programming, engaging in personal projects, all with the aim of continuous growth and professional advancement.
